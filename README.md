Step 1: Start by converting your video, which you can name "input.mp4", into an .mp3 file. 

Step 2: Harness the power of OpenAI's Whisper to convert your audio into text effortlessly. Itâ€™s incredibly straightforward! This repository is just a glimpse into the larger project, Next Vision, with exciting updates on the horizon!

Step 3: Next, we utilize NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) to refine the text. It intelligently tokenizes the content, filters out unnecessary stopwords, and creates a detailed frequency table with scores. For a more in-depth understanding, check out this reference: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-text-summarizer/.

Step 4: And just like that, your lengthy YouTube videos are transformed into concise, impactful paragraphs! You can experience the ease and efficiency of summarizing your content today. 

Note: I have attached a sample "input.mp4" in the repository, you can replace it with a file of your choice

Happy Coding!
